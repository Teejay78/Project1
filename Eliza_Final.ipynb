    "The Eliza chatbot is one of the earliest examples of a natural lannguage program that was created in the 1960s by Joseph Weizenbaum (add citation). Eliza works by using simple pattern matching and substitution techniques that give the illusion that Eliza understands the user input. It spots keywords in user input and responds with predeined scripts or transforms statements into questions. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, Project Group 10 set out to mimix the functionality of the original Eliza chatbot to demostrate our understanding of regular expressions and basic natural language processing. By implementing word-spotting and statement trasnformation logic, we created a simple interactive chatbot that responds to user input in a way that simulates a supportive psychotherapist. This project allowed us to apply regex-based pattern matching and conversational flow design to explore how early NLP systems like Eliza were able to engage users using rul-based responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our code begins by importing the required packages. The re package is utilized in order for Eliza to recognize regex patterns. Random is used to randomly select possible responses. The nltk package is used to parse user input and lemmatize the tokens to allow for more robust pattern recognition. \n",
    "We next set up our Eliza chatbot to handle pronoun transformations. We accomplished this by defining what pronouns needed to be transformed. We then defined the function transform_patterns. This function is used to transform I want, I feel, I am, and I don't know statements into questions while incorporating our pronoun transformations. For example, this would transform the statement 'I am sad' to 'Why are you sad?'. It should be noted that this transformation only occurs if a phrase defined in our pattern tuple isn't recognized. Our pattern tuple defines certain regex patterns and creates predefined responses relating to topics such as emotions, health, and identity. We then define fallback responses that occur when a word pattern is not recognized in user input. Our lemmatize_input function lemmatizes lemmatizes each word in user input- meaning that it reduces it down to its most basic form. This enables our regex patterns to be able to capture a wider range of user input. \n",
    "\n",
    "Project Group Ten added several \"bonus features\" to this chatbot. We began my adding a time-appropriate greeting using the function time_of_day_greeting. This function records the system time of the user and greets them with either good morning, good afternoon, or good evening. Our group next added a time delay built into the eliza_response function. This was in order to allow a sense of \"realness\" as if our Eliza was \"thinking\" of a response. The last bonus feature we added was through the function random_encouraging_statements. As the name suggests, this function allowed our Eliza bot to provide random encouraging statements 20% of the time."

    "This function is the core logic of our Eliza chatbot. It begins by calling the time_of_day function to gather the user's system hour and provide an appropriate greeting. It then prompts the user for their name and removes any extra whitespace around the input. Eliza replies, greeting the user by name using the eliza_response function, which includes the time delay and Eliza is typing feature. It then starts an infinite loop that runs until the user types exit, quit, or bye. It will ask the user for their next statement and remove extra spaces. If the user indicates that they want to end the session, Eliza responds and the loop breaks. The input is lemmatized. The input is checked to see if it fits any known sentence structures, such as \"I want\". If there is a match, the transform_patterns function is used to provide a realistic question transformation. It will then send this response and skip this in the next loop iteration. If there is no transformation match, it checks for keywords. If matches, Eliza responds with the pre-defined message. Eliza then has a 20% chance of providing a random encouraging statement. If no patterns or transformation match, Eliza picks a generic fallback. "
